All intellectual property rights in our services remain our property. Your use of our services does not grant you any rights to our intellectual property.

For dispute resolution, we have established specific procedures based on your jurisdiction. For users in the United States, disputes shall be resolved through the American Arbitration Association (AAA) with a seat of arbitration in Washington, DC.

You agree to resolve any disputes on an individual basis. Class actions and class arbitrations are not permitted. This arbitration agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. Notwithstanding this arbitration agreement, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court.

These terms include jurisdiction-specific rights and protections. Users in the European Union and United Kingdom retain their rights under GDPR and consumer protection laws, including a 14-day cooling-off period for purchases. Australian users retain their rights under Australian Consumer Law and Privacy Principles. Canadian users retain their rights under PIPEDA and provincial consumer protection laws.
