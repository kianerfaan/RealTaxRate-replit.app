# Privacy Policy

Last Updated: February 14, 2025

We believe in absolute privacy through non-collection of data. Our approach is simple: we do not collect, store, or process any personal information from visitors to this website. We achieve this by operating without cookies, tracking mechanisms, or any form of user monitoring systems.

Our commitment to privacy extends across all jurisdictions. In the United States, we meet the requirements of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (VCDPA), and other state privacy laws through our fundamental practice of non-collection. For our European Union visitors, we align with GDPR requirements by conducting no data processing activities and making no data transfers. In the United Kingdom, our practices naturally comply with UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018 as we perform no data collection or processing activities.

Canadian visitors can be assured that we meet PIPEDA requirements and provincial privacy laws through our non-collection stance. For our Australian users, we satisfy the Privacy Act 1988 and Australian Privacy Principles by maintaining zero data collection. Japanese visitors can trust that we comply with the Act on the Protection of Personal Information (APPI) through our commitment to handling no personal data.

For transparency, we note that while we do not collect personal data, our servers automatically record IP addresses for essential site maintenance. These logs are automatically cleared within 24 hours and are never associated with any user identity. We use no cookies and implement no tracking technologies.

We may update this privacy policy as needed. Any significant changes will be prominently displayed on our website. Since we do not collect contact information, we cannot notify you directly of changes, so we encourage you to review this policy periodically.

If you have questions or concerns, you can reach us at kianerfaan@proton.me. While traditional privacy rights such as data access, correction, deletion, or portability do not apply here (as we collect no data to access, correct, delete, or transfer), we welcome any inquiries about our privacy practices.

We extend this commitment to children's privacy, though it bears noting that we do not knowingly collect information from anyone, regardless of age. Your use of this website indicates your understanding and acceptance of these practices.
